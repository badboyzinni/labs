lets begin ðŸ˜ˆ

### Wazuh cloud instance 

no dependencies required
install wazuh and extract credentials 

refer to this repo   `Wazuh-Install-Instructions`

### TheHive cloud instance

install java
install cassandra
![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/3714c990-a435-437b-9615-e952991fe8e9)

install elastic search
![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/012b9726-1573-4bf6-9272-7d8b3f175d21)

install the hive
![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/73339c0b-90af-4e82-aa37-6b1b2dd25f79)


### Windows VM

setup sysmon and configure


get the sysmon config file from 
`https://github.com/olafhartong/sysmon-modular/blob/master/sysmonconfig.xml` 

what you need is the sysmonconfig.xml file 

put it all in the same folder and use the command `./Sysmonx64.exe -i sysmon.xml`

go to services and confirm if sysmon is running 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/0022b3bb-abaf-4be7-ab8d-60cf9eee1070)

## -

### Now lets configure the hive

starting with cassandra
`nano /etc/casssandra/cassandra.yaml`

edit cluster name
 
![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/c26af92f-78b5-43c8-87bf-68ac418546d2)

edit listen, rpc and seed provider -this is the same as the ip address of your machine
 
![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/b8e395a8-bff3-4ca9-a82f-f3f643443bd0)
![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/31b643e8-cbc9-4f7e-9c93-5b95984854ec)
![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/f2cd775f-96dd-4f25-84ce-7c4e3ed46fa9)

stop cassandra

`systemctl stop cassandra.service`

delete old files and restart

`rm -rf /var/lib/cassandra/*`

`systemctl start cassandra.service`
  
![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/42ee75b4-e6ac-4721-a3fb-8439280422f4)

run same process for elasticsearch

`nano /etc/elasticsearch/elasticsearch.yml`

edit cluster name, rpc & seed provider 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/b9fb720d-8516-41a2-813b-21b3b0f3a5b1)

start and emable elastic search 

`systemctl start elasticsearch.service`
`systemctl enable elasticsearch.service`

up & running 
![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/ee48323a-0136-4058-bc9d-33581ee262d1) 


now, make sure thehive user and group has access to a file path

`ls -la /opt/thp`

we can see that root user has access here
![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/0336b937-e70e-4686-8aba-11f7742f1191)


now, lets make thehive owner 

`chown -R thehive:thehive /opt/thp`

check again, nice 
![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/bd268e21-a6e5-4bb3-9972-a9f443d9d0bc)


now lets configure thehive configuration file 

`nano /etc/thehive/application.conf`

edit hostmane, IP address & base url 

start and enable thehive.service 
![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/dff80aaa-dcfb-493b-8829-17a362c8831a)


we login with default credntials and got hit with an error

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/d2416e25-15dd-434b-9ed2-688d43047170)

apparently elasticsearch went down

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/63d76455-a149-4502-87a2-695e0c1dfbd5)

lets create a custom jvl file

`nano /etc/elasticsearch/jvm.options.d/jvm.options`

paste a command that tells java to limit its memory 4gsb

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/8b2d2082-7db7-4ccf-a77e-df68b0a0018c)

restart elasticsearch

now we have access to thehive console 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/6c8198d1-92ca-400d-8cb8-150fa458c3c5)


### Adding agents into Wazuh

lets add agents into Wazuh, as we can see we have 0 agents 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/11991df2-94ae-4697-ac16-d585d8c6a23e)

i'll be deploying a Windows agent...i'll input the IP add of the wazuh and then copy the command in green circle to my windows powershell 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/c87add15-29e3-48ce-acae-14c4885bb9c3)

wazuh is installed 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/b96d5767-808e-4a40-988b-dba1f67d4ea3)

start the service 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/a2bbbc2c-3e8c-428a-83ae-833dcb922114)

back on the wazuh dashboard, we can see that our agent has been synced. ggs 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/254dc4b3-3eb1-4886-8588-c7956c330af0)

### Lets generate telemetry from our agent and ingest into Wazuh

lets find out wazuh configuration file on the Win10 agent 
c:/Program Files (x86)/ossec-agent/ossec.conf

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/59014739-6d97-4f8b-9013-09220bce217a)

i integrate previously installed sysmon and powershell into wazuh

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/32ff21fc-fc7a-4400-9482-67ab6bab6a01)

then restart wazuh in the services tab. 

`any time you make a change, always restart the service`

*back into wazuh*

we an see that logs are already being sent and ingested 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/0ace3c48-a7d4-4098-a9d8-9b71f3346896)

now lets download a know credential extractor mimikatz
execute the .exe file 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/59cc9ea3-927a-4450-bb14-6ab6334b6f21)

but our wazuh did not log anything because `sysmon` didnt repoort it

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/9863fc99-9d45-4d8e-875f-54bd862405f7)

lets fix that :(  -  we're gonna modify the ossec.conf file  
make a backup

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/51d7d953-c85d-4fe9-a7d9-f6ab8e084cfb)

edit the log all section to yes 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/0de05f34-7929-4ebb-81d8-e9715118bf26)

restart the wazuh-manager.service. what i just did will force wazuh to archive all the logs into this dir.

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/8cbaa656-ee1e-4073-b1d7-7b1bae63eaab)

to start injestion, lets change the config of filebeat 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/e67fc12d-6bf8-4777-a353-8a7fa0642236)

restart filebeat.service

*back to wazuh* lets update our indexer to view these logs 

goto stack management, index patterns, create index pattern
create new index wazuh-archives-**
save 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/16d493cf-47bc-4828-a489-d1b8b964c2e1)

back to discover 
select the new index

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/2f1990a9-b763-4a4d-8a0f-80f5c5de7065)

no indexes stil. regerate the mimikatz executabele 

now its injesting 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/dcf07525-e2a2-4007-8c4c-a3fc79fc12e6)

so i had an hacker with me after this step and he executed a credential dump using mimikatz :(

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/4091ed7c-6ef6-46fd-9525-f05c51deddda)

and Wazuh reported it under Sysmon/Operational

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/b5d04f9b-9084-4def-83ea-283756a711dd)

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/bc97974b-4d41-4f94-96ee-e2a15f1f2337)


now we craft alerts using specific keywords like OriginalFileName
so regardless of name change, itll still show up

can be done via the cli in `/var/ossec/ruleset/rules/` but we can do it via the Wazuh dashboard

Dashboard > MAnagement > Rules > Custom rules 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/e3b857b8-fe9e-4429-8120-9e78fae64367)

save & restart

now we can see that our alert is customized and the rule level is updated 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/003cfc25-5fa2-483e-a3a9-e30e86bd2057)


## Connect Shuffle x Send alert to TheHive & Send to Email

on `shuffler.io`  we're gonna create a new workflow 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/dd2cd7ea-b5a1-4ebb-8695-a90f5ab234c9)

we add a WebHook or the workspace and copy the URI. this is so because we'll be adding it to out ossec.conf configuration file

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/0a665ad8-5319-4d26-a19c-e163862d40da)

back in the Wazuh cli
`nano /var/ossec/etc/ossec.conf` we'll add an integration tag that relects our rule id 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/97b170cd-491d-42e9-8567-eb06bfe92421)

be sure to edit the conf file properly or it wont restart
restart the manager 

## `5 troubleshooting sessions later`

now, regenerate the mimikatz command on the windows client machine 

return to our workspace on `shuffler.io`   

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/53ee88a9-c465-43ed-afe3-a70f575b15f4)

now the logs are showing up on the workflow

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/d190eb67-9376-447f-b748-92036197b9a4)

nice 

this is what we'll be replicating 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/1d4711dc-be04-4a50-a216-d4bfdae7d2db)

now lets automte the alert by parsing out the hash value

first copy out your hash value from the exe argument 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/600ffe42-ae76-4c83-939d-01e8940a46c5)

edit the Change Me workflow details 

change capture group and input data to view hash function

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/e3f70449-f0c2-4925-b216-183ac71438a7)

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/86e0f240-148d-4dd9-a88e-c2362346b340)

now use GPT to create the regex prompt 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/c5cc1878-251a-4c2a-acdd-18e5f1ada402)

you should get this    `SHA256=([A-Fa-f0-9]{64})`

save workflow and refresh

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/21e79a8a-f8ac-49a3-aea9-d72735ee35e5)

now the hash data has been parsed out 

rename the change me workflow to SHA256_REGEX

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/9e998d73-bdb5-4e47-be44-3a3a51ab3d9b)


##lets send this to virustotal

create an account on  `virustotal.com`
get your api key

in   `shuffler.io`   search, activate an add the virustotal instance

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/03a1b2cc-58d7-4e6c-87d1-1b2337e65533)

input yor api key, ensure the find actions is on   `get a hash report`  and the Id is facing `$sha256_regex.group_0.#`

confirm the details, save and refresh the workflow

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/57770871-081a-4dd3-9024-13e758b446cf)

theres an error :( .. not exactly what we want to see 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/cd7fd5bd-e077-424e-9eed-8b47563d38cb)

on  `shuffler.io`   go to apps, find virus total, open in a new tab then fork the app to create another instance for your workflow

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/d60aaf8a-0693-46ec-8d87-cd9626278ad6)
![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/6fbaf510-e0ff-4f45-b6e1-864e16ed44b9)

go to the get a hash report function 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/78f1079d-68e8-474c-b42c-7c91cf4c273b)

ensure its pointed to that directory 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/cb77426d-19a1-4407-8a5f-b7f240d7e07e)

back to the workflow page, 

delete the old virustotal instance, add your forked instance 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/86847bd8-f342-4eab-8edc-f3239a95de05)

authenticate and configure, save and re run the process

now this is what we need to see 

![image](https://github.com/maybewale/siem-lab/assets/78131867/639a1833-7f3f-4ff9-9b87-00b74588938f)

##lets send these to the hive
